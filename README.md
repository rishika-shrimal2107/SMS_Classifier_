Welcome to the SMS Spam Classifier project! This project aims to build a machine learning-based classifier to detect spam messages from regular text messages. By leveraging a Naive Bayes model trained on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, the classifier can accurately predict whether a message is spam or not.

## ➲About the Project

The SMS Spam Classifier project utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset containing a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. The dataset is sourced from the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, available on platforms like Kaggle. The model is trained using natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of each message and identify patterns indicative of spam.

## ➲Features

- Streamlit Web App: The SMS spam classifier is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can input text messages and receive real-time predictions on whether the message is spam or not.
- Machine Learning Model: The core of the project is a Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on a preprocessed dataset of SMS messages. The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

## ➲How to Use

To use the SMS Spam Classifier:
1. Access the web application deployed on Heroku: [Link to Web App](#)
2. Enter a text message into the input field.
3. Click the "Predict" button to receive a prediction on whether the message is spam or not.
